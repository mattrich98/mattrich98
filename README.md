### Welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Ž
 
I've been learning on the Mimo app on the appstore in the meantime, before continuing with the odin project. So far, I have got a better understanding of arrays methods and loops now. Probably I have a decent understanding of 
DOM manipulation and events too. So I'll soon learn about objects and be able to complete the foundations course.
