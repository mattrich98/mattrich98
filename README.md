### Welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Ž
<hr>
My motivation goes up and down, since I dedicate a lot of time to digital art. But I try when I can. In the future, I would like to make projects that incorporate both areas.
<br>
<br>
I also want to get into 'Screeps: World', a JavaScript game. Its fun, so I will improve while having a good time.
<br>
<br>
Most of my initial coding experience comes from editing other users scripts on ROBLOX; during highschool days. 
<br>
<br>
I completed the rock paper scissors project, so I'll draw for the rest of the day. This way I will be in the mood to finish the green house project. 
<br>
<br>
In the future, I plan to make flashplayer-like games, so I will have a whole lot more motivation to finish those. 
<br>
<br>
Some things I forget, but I kind of know what I want to do. I just google the syntax that fits the plan or idea.

<h3>Project Ideas</h3>

<strong>TODO list</strong>
<ol>
  <li>save/loading, maybe attaching a file from computer to a website. I think that the TODO list being a website, would be convienent to use</li> 
  <li>button tick if complete</li>
  <li>history for most features</li>
  <li>time/date wrote todo and for completed </li>
  <li>for each TODO, maybe another button for how difficult a task is)</li>
</ol>
