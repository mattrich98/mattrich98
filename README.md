My motivation goes up and down, since I dedicate a lot of time to digital art. But I try when I can. In the future, I would like to make projects that incorporate both areas.

<h3>Project ideas:</h3>
<br>
<strong>TODO list</strong>
<ol>
  <li>save/loading, maybe attaching a file from computer to a website. I think that the TODO list being a website, would be convienent to use</li> 
  <li>button tick if complete</li>
  <li>history for most features</li>
  <li>time/date wrote todo and for completed </li>
  <li>for each TODO, maybe another button for how difficult a task is)</li>
</ol>
