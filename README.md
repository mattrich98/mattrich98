### Welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Ž
 
Since I burnt out again, I'm planning to continue with the odin project even if I don't fully understand concepts yet. Overall just having the idea/mindset that I need to use this specific method in order to deal with a specific problem. 

But I have also been considering focusing on 3D modelling since I did that during college. 

Now I have decided to try using AI to make explanations super simple and easy for me to understand, with easy vocabulary so that It doesn't feel like a slog to learn. I like coding but I also find it a slog to learn new things with digital art too.
