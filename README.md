### Welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Ž
Once I complete greenhouse project, I will continue with the Odin project again.
<br>
I have to get better at Arrays and loops as its difficult to complete those exercises
<br>
I'll complete the w3school tutorials from JS Arrays to JS Loop While before continuing. Overall, I want to get used to incorporating methods more.
